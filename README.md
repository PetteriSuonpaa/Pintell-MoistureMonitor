**Course:** ELEC-C9822 â€“ Design Thinking and Advanced Prototyping (10 credits)  
**Purpose:** Pintell is designed to monitor your laundry's moisture levels in real-time, letting you know exactly when your clothes are dry. It saves time and energy compared to using dryers, relying on the weather, or checking manually.
**Note:** Unlike a traditional clothespin, Pintellâ€™s primary focus is **accurate moisture monitoring**, not holding clothes in place. For best results, clip it to the *bottom* of the garment: moisture naturally moves downward as clothes dry, and the bottom retains moisture the longest. The **core functionality of Pintell is precise real-time moisture data**, even though the form is inspired by the familiar clothespin.

## System Overview
Pintell combines smart electronics, embedded programming, and cloud connectivity to deliver actionable laundry insights:

- **Electronics:** Sensors detect moisture levels accurately; PCB and power management ensure durability and efficiency.
- **Embedded Programming:** Microcontroller firmware processes sensor data and communicates with the app.
- **Cloud Services:** Real-time data storage and analysis for user notifications.
- **Mobile App:** Displays moisture readings and sends alerts when laundry is dry.

## Hardware Overview
**Petteri SuonpÃ¤Ã¤ â€“ Electronics Engineering**  
This was my role and I Designed and developed the electronic system for Pintell. Key highlights:

- **Moisture Sensor:** High-accuracy sensor integrated at the bottom of the garment for precise readings.  
- **PCB Design:** Compact layout optimized for low power consumption and durability.  
- **Power Management:** Efficient battery system enabling extended use between charges.  
- **Connectivity:** Microcontroller handles sensor data and transmits it to the mobile app.
