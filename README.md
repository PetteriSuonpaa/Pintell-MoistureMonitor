# Pintell – Smart Laundry Moisture Monitor

![Pintell Final Product](images/final_product.jpg) <!-- Replace with your actual image path -->

## Purpose
Pintell is designed to monitor your laundry's moisture levels in real-time, letting you know exactly when your clothes are dry. This saves time and energy compared to relying on dryers, weather, or manually checking garments.

**Note:** Unlike a traditional clothespin, Pintell’s primary focus is **accurate moisture monitoring**, not holding clothes in place. For best results, clip it to the *bottom* of the garment: moisture naturally moves downward as clothes dry, and the bottom retains moisture the longest. The **core functionality of Pintell is precise real-time moisture data**, even though the form is inspired by the familiar clothespin.

## System Overview
Pintell combines smart electronics, embedded programming, and cloud connectivity to deliver actionable laundry insights:

- **Electronics:** Sensors detect moisture levels accurately; PCB and power management ensure durability and efficiency.
- **Embedded Programming:** Microcontroller firmware processes sensor data and communicates with the app.
- **Cloud Services:** Real-time data storage and analysis for user notifications.
- **Mobile App:** Displays moisture readings and sends alerts when laundry is dry.
